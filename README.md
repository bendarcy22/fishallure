FishAllure is a Ruby on Rails web app that allows fishermen to post photos of their catch via CarrierWave, and integrates the Mapbox API, via the Leaflet library, to allow fishermen to pin markers to a map so they can track where they have caught fish.

I've always wanted to be able to track important fishing information, such as what fish are around, where they are being caught and what they are being caught on. FishAllure takes all this pertinent information and makes it searchable and easy to understand
